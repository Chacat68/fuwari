## 文字稿

[applause] Thank you.
[掌声] 谢谢。

[applause] I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.
[掌声] 今天，能与你们一同参加这所世界顶尖大学的毕业典礼，我感到无比荣幸。

[applause]
[掌声]

Truth be told, I never graduated from college,
说实话，我从未从大学毕业，

and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.
这是我离大学毕业最近的一次。

[laughter]
[笑声]

Today, I want to tell you three stories from my life.
今天，我想讲述我人生中的三个故事。

That's it.
就这样。

No big deal.
没什么大不了的。

Just three stories.
仅三个故事。

The first story is about connecting the dots.
第一个故事是关于如何把生命中的点点滴滴串连起来。

I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months,
我在里德学院只读了六个月就退学了。

but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
但之后我又以兼职的形式待了大约18个月，才真正辞职。

So why did I drop out?
那么，我为何选择退学呢？

It started before I was born.
这一切在我出生之前就已开始。

My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student,
我的生母是一位年轻的未婚研究生，

and she decided to put me up for adoption.
她决定把我送去领养。

She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates,
她强烈认为我应该被大学毕业生收养。

so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.
因此，我出生后的一切都已安排妥当，将由一位律师和他的妻子收养。

Except that when I popped out,
只不过当我蹦出来时，

they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
他们在最后一刻决定，他们真的想要一个女孩。

So my parents, who were on a waiting list,
我的父母当时在等待名单上，

got a call in the middle of the night asking,
半夜接到电话问，

"We've got an unexpected baby boy.
我们意外得了个男宝宝。

Do you want him?"
你想要他吗？

They said, "Of course."
他们说：“当然。”

My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school.
我的生母后来发现，我的养母根本没有上过大学，我的养父甚至连高中都没毕业。

She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
她拒绝签署最终的收养文件。

She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college.
几个月后，她才勉强同意，因为我的父母保证我会去上大学。

This was the start in my life.
这是我人生的起点。

And 17 years later, I did go to college,
17年后，我确实上了大学，

but I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford.
但我天真地选择了一所几乎和斯坦福一样昂贵的大学。

And all of my working class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.
我工薪阶层的父母的所有积蓄都花在了我的大学学费上。

After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
六个月后，我看不出它有什么价值。

I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
我完全不知道自己的人生想要做什么，也不清楚大学如何能帮我找到答案。

And here I was,
而我就在这里，

spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life.
花光了父母毕生积蓄的所有钱。

So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay.
于是我决定退学，并且相信这一切都会顺利解决。

It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back,
当时确实挺吓人的，但回想起来，

it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
这是我做过的最好的决定之一。

The minute I dropped out,
我一退学，

I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.
我可以不再上那些必修却无趣的课程，转而旁听那些看起来更有意思的课。

It wasn't all romantic.
并非一切都那么浪漫。

I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms.
我没有宿舍，只能睡在朋友房间的地板上。

I returned Coke bottles for the five-cent deposits to buy food with.
我为了买食物，把可乐瓶退回去换五分钱的押金。

And I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.
每个星期天晚上，我都会步行七英里穿过市区，去哈瑞·克里希纳神庙享用一周唯一的一顿美餐。

I loved it.
我很喜欢它。

And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.
我跟随好奇心和直觉所涉足的许多事物，后来都成了无价之宝。

Let me give you one example.
让我给你举个例子。

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.
当时的里德学院提供了可能是全国最好的书法教育。

Throughout the campus, every poster,
校园内，每一张海报、

every label on every drawer was beautifully hand-calligraphed.
每个抽屉上的标签都用手写书法精美地标注着。

Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes,
因为我退了学，不用去上常规课程，

I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.
我决定参加书法班学习这门技艺。

I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces,
我学习了衬线字体和无衬线字体的知识。

about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations,
关于调整不同字母组合之间的间距

about what makes great typography great.
关于优秀排版的要素。

It was beautiful, historical,
它美丽，富有历史感，

artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture.
艺术上微妙之处，科学难以捕捉。

And I found it fascinating.
我觉得这非常有趣。

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.
这一切在我生活中毫无实际应用的可能。

But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,
但十年后，在设计第一台Macintosh电脑时，

it all came back to me.
一切都回到了我的记忆中。

And we designed it all into the Mac.
我们将这一切设计都融入了Mac之中。

It was the first computer with beautiful typography.
这是第一台拥有精美字体的电脑。

If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,
如果我没有在大学里旁听过那门课程，

the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.
Mac电脑就不会拥有多种字体或比例间距字体。

And since Windows just copied the Mac,
既然Windows只是模仿了Mac，

it's likely that no personal computer would have them.
很可能没有个人电脑会配备它们。

[applause]
[掌声]

If I had never dropped out,
如果我从未辍学，

I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class.
我本不该去上那门书法课。

And personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.
个人电脑可能就不会有如今这般出色的排版效果。

Of course,
当然

it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college.
在大学时，我无法预见未来如何将点滴串联起来。

But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.
但十年后回首，一切都变得非常、非常清晰。

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward.
再次强调，你无法预知未来，将点滴串联起来。

You can only connect them looking backwards.
你只能在回顾时将它们联系起来。

So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
所以你必须相信，这些点滴会在你未来的某一天串连起来。

You have to trust in something.
你必须相信某些东西。

Your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
你的直觉、命运、人生、业力，随便你怎么称呼。

Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path.
因为相信这些点滴会在未来串连起来，会给你信心去追随你的内心，即使它引领你离开寻常的道路。

And that will make all the difference.
这将带来天壤之别。

My second story is about love and loss.
我的第二个故事是关于爱与失去。

I was lucky.
我很幸运。

I found what I loved to do early in life.
我很早就找到了自己热爱的事业。

Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20.
我和沃兹在我父母的车库里创办了苹果公司，那时我20岁。

We worked hard and in ten years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company with over 4,000

as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me.

But something slowly began to dawn on me.
但我逐渐意识到了一些事情。

I still loved what I did.

The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.
苹果公司的变故丝毫没有改变这一点。

I'd been rejected but I was still in love.
我被拒绝了，但我依然爱着。

And so I decided to start over.
于是我决定重新开始。

I didn't see it then but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
当时我并未意识到，但事实证明，被苹果公司解雇是我人生中可能发生的最好的事情。

The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again.
成功的沉重被重新成为初学者的轻松所取代。

Less sure about everything.
对一切都更加不确定。

It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.
这让我得以进入一生中最富创造力的阶段。

During the next five years I started a company named Next.
接下来的五年里，我创办了一家名为NeXT的公司。

Another company named Pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.

I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.

Sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick.
有时候，生活会给你当头一棒。

Don't lose faith.

[Applause] My third story is about death.

"If you live each day as if it was your last,
如果你把每一天都当作生命中的最后一天去生活，

someday you'll most certainly be right."
总有一天你肯定会是对的。

[Laughter]

It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years,
这给我留下了深刻印象，自那以后的33年里，

I've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself,

"If today were the last day of my life,

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

I had a scan at 7.30

I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.
医生告诉我，这几乎肯定是一种无法治愈的癌症，我预计只能再活三到六个月。

My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,
我的医生建议我回家，把自己的事情安排妥当。

which is doctor's code for "prepare to die."

the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.

Beneath it were the words, "Stay hungry, stay foolish."
