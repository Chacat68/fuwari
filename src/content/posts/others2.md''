Life, thin and light-off time and time again

生命，一次又一次轻薄过

Frivolous tireless

轻狂不知疲倦

I heard the echo, from the valleys and the heart

我听见回声，来自山谷和心间

Open to the lonely soul of sickle harvesting

以寂寞的镰刀收割空旷的灵魂

Repeat outrightly, but also repeat the well-being of eventually swaying in the desert oasis

不断地重复决绝，又重复幸福,终有绿洲摇曳在沙漠

I believe I am

我相信自己

Born as the bright summer flowers

生来如同璀璨的夏日之花

Do not withered undefeated fiery demon rule

不凋不败，妖冶如火

Heart rate and breathing to bear the load of the cumbersome Bored

承受心跳的负荷和呼吸的累赘 乐此不疲

I heard the music, from the moon and carcass

我听见音乐，来自月光和胴体

Auxiliary extreme aestheticism bait to capture misty

辅极端的诱饵捕获飘渺的唯美

Filling the intense life, but also filling the pure

一生充盈着激烈，又充盈着纯然

There are always memories throughout the earth

总有回忆贯穿于世间

I believe I am

我相信自己

Died as the quiet beauty of autumn leaves

死时如同静美的秋日落叶

Sheng is not chaos, smoke gesture

不盛不乱，姿态如烟

Even wilt also retained bone proudly Qing Feng muscle Occult

即便枯萎也保留丰肌清骨的傲然 玄之又玄

I hear love, I believe in love

我听见爱情，我相信爱情

Love is a pool of struggling blue-green algae

爱情是一潭挣扎的蓝藻

As desolate micro-burst of wind

如同一阵凄微的风

Bleeding through my veins

穿过我失血的静脉

Years stationed in the belief

驻守岁月的信念

I believe that all can hear

我相信一切能够听见

Even anticipate discrete, I met the other their own

甚至预见离散，遇见另一个自己

Some can not grasp the moment

而有些瞬间无法把握

Left to the East to go West, the dead must not return to nowhere

任凭东走西顾，逝去的必然不返

See, I wear Zan Flowers on my head, in full bloom along the way all the way

请看我头置簪花，一路走来一路盛开

Frequently missed some, but also deeply moved by wind, frost, snow or rain

频频遗漏一些，又深陷风霜雨雪的感动

Prajna Paramita, soon as soon as life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves

般若波罗蜜，一声一声,生如夏花，死如秋叶

Also care about what has

还在乎拥有什么
